# Hydration Reminder App
## Features Implemented

1. Reminder Schedule: The app alerts the user every two hours from 8 AM to 8PM to drink water. These reminders help users maintain regular water intake without having to manually set reminders throughout the day.
2. User Interaction: Implemented a simple and intuitive interface through which user can start or stop the hydration reminders. This feature allows users flexibility depending on their daily needs and activities.
3. Notification System: The app utilizes Android's built-in notification system to alert users at the specified times. Each notification will encourage the user to drink a glass of water, thus aiding in better hydration habits.
4. Customizable Reminder Schedule: The user can set their own reminder intervals (e.g., every hour, every three hours) and start/end times based on their personal hydration needs or lifestyle along with a message theyâ€™d like to be shown in the notification.
5. Hydration Tracker: Users can log the amount of water they drink throughout the day.
6. Hydration Goal Setting: The app suggest daily water intake goals based on their body weight, but users can also set their own daily water intake goals.
7. Local Data Storage: I used local data storage (shared preferences) to save whether the reminder is active or not, to track how much water they drank, and also to save their water intake goals (suggested based on weight and their own personal goals). This ensures that the app remembers the user's preferences and operates accordingly, even after the app is closed or the device is restarted.
